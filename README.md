# 🏗️ Construction Project – Full Stack App

This project is a full stack construction management system built with **Node.js**, **MongoDB**, and **React**.  
It includes three separate repositories, each responsible for a different part of the system:

---

### 🖥️ [Server](https://github.com/danbiton/Server) 
Back-end built with **Node.js** + **Express**, connected to **MongoDB** using **Mongoose**.

🔹 Handles all API functionality  
🔹 User authentication and authorization logic  
🔹 Connects both admin and client sides to the database

---

### 🛠️ [Admin Panel](https://github.com/danbiton/Admin)  
Admin interface built with **React**.

🔹 View and manage tables (users, roles, reports, etc.)  
🔹 Admin-level permissions and role-based access  
🔹 Manage construction site settings and workers

---

### 👷 [Client Interface](https://github.com/danbiton/Client)  
Client-side React app for on-site employees.

🔹 Employees login and view their assigned tasks  
🔹 Submit issues/faults from the field  
🔹 Limited permissions according to role

---

🧠 This system was designed with scalability, security, and role-based management in mind.
